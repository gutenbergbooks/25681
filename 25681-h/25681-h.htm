<div class="indent0">&ldquo;Excited the spleen of the birds and the beasts;&rdquo;</div>
<div>How the peacock and turkey &ldquo;flew into a passion,&rdquo;</div>
<div>On finding that insects &ldquo;pretended to fashion.&rdquo;</div>
<div>Now, I often have thought it exceedingly hard,</div>
<div>That nought should be said of the beasts by the bard;</div>
<div>Who, by some strange neglect, has omitted to state</div>
<div>That the quadrupeds gave a magnificent fête;</div>
<div>So, out of sheer justice I take up my pen,</div>
<div>To tell you the how, and the where, and the when.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">The place which they chose was a wild chestnut ground,</div>
<div>(And many such spots in the new world are found,)</div>
<div><a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Where the evergreen oak and the cucumber trees</div>
<div>Rear aloft their tall branches, and wave in the breeze;</div>
<div>Where the hickory, cypress, and cabbage-tree grow,</div>
<div>And shade the sweet flowers that blossom below;</div>
<div>And the creepers and vines form a beautiful sight,</div>
<div>As they climb the tall shaft, and hang down from a height;</div>
<div>Or they mix with the long pendant moss which is found</div>
<div>Growing high on the branches, yet touching the ground:</div>
<div>From amidst the dark foliage the mocking-birds sing,</div>
<div>Or mimic the hum of the honey-bees&#8217; wing,</div>
<div>As they whirl round a flower enjoying the feast,</div>
<div>So unsparingly spread for bird, insect, or beast.</div>
<div>From afar the bald eagle is seen in the sky,</div>
<div>Now darting below, and now soaring on high;</div>
<div>Now he takes from the fish-hawk his newly caught prey,</div>
<div>And with speed to the forest he bears it away;</div>
<div>Whilst the wood is alive with a feathery throng,</div>
<div>Who from morning till night fill the air with their song.</div>
<div>On one side is the lake where the wild cattle drink,</div>
<div>And trample the rice which grows wild on its brink;</div>
<div>The freshness untouch&#8217;d of earth&#8217;s beauties declare,</div>
<div>Neither pride, pomp, nor envy, have ever been there;</div>
<div><a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

<div>Foot of man hath not pass&#8217;d o&#8217;er that prairie I ween,</div>
<div>Unless some few wandering Indians have pass&#8217;d&mdash;</div>
<div>Of their sorrowing tribe perhaps nearly the last.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">I should fail to describe in a picturesque manner</div>
<div>The splendid repose of that grassy Savanna;</div>
<div class="triple">Tall shadows swept out from the forest of pine,<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
<div class="triple">The site was a fair one, the weather so fine,<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span

<div class="triple">That even a quadruped thought it divine.<span
 class="ns">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">To this wild grassy spot, on the long look&#8217;d for day,</div>
<div>Merry parties of beasts made the best of their way;</div>
<div>There were bears, long and short-legg&#8217;d, black, brown, grey, and white,</div>
<div>From different parts, to enjoy the fine sight.</div>
<div>The polar bear came in a sledge, and she said</div>
<div>That the journey had caused a sharp pain in her head:</div>
<div>For, although well protected from snout to her tail,</div>
<div>She thought she had got a slight &ldquo;coup-de-soleil;&rdquo;</div>
<div>So she hastily called for a gallon of ice,</div>
<div>Which a monkey in waiting served up in a trice.</div>
<div><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Then the jaguar, the couguar, and fierce Ocelot,</div>
<div>And Sir Hans Armadillo, who came at full trot,</div>
<div>Brother Jonathan Beaver, escaped from the trappers,</div>
<div>Sloth, Tortoise, and Dormouse, notorious nappers.</div>
<div>That beau, the musk-Ox, with his long scented hair,</div>
<div>And John Bull just arrived on his travels, were there;</div>
<div>Messrs. Martin, Hare, Squirrel, the Ermine, and Stoat,</div>
<div>And the rock-mountain sheep, with his cousin, the goat;</div>
<div>Then the sociable marmot, and tiny shrew mouse,</div>
<div>The raccoon and agouti from hollow-tree house.</div>
<div>Chinchilla the soft, musk and Canada rats,</div>
<div>Hounds, mastiffs, wolves, foxes, and wild tiger cats;</div>
<div>Jerboa just roused from his long winter nap,</div>
<div>Opossum, with four little babes in her lap.</div>
<div>The morse, seal, and otter&mdash;amphibious group!</div>
<div>And of bisons (the humpbacked) there came a whole troop.</div>
<div>It seems that the elk out of pride staid away,</div>
<div>Having just shed his horns, which he does about May.</div>
<div>The fallow and red-deer were gone to a lick,</div>
<div>With a numerous party, who thought themselves sick;</div>
<div>But the antelope, stag, and the Wapiti deer,</div>
<div>Notwithstanding the age of the latter, were there.</div>
<div><a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Esquimaux dogs, red, white, brindled, and black,</div>
<div>Who, for fear of the wolves, had arrived in a pack,</div>
<div>Were not heard to speak in the course of the day,</div>
<div>And were thought by the rest &ldquo;to have nothing to say.&rdquo;</div>
<div>But if they were silent, &#8217;twas clear they could growl,</div>
<div>And on meeting the wolf, gave a wild dismal howl;</div>
<div>For although &#8217;twas supposed they were slightly connected,</div>
<div>In quarrels and fights they&#8217;d been often detected;</div>
<div>Though &#8217;tis true, all dislikes for this day were forbidden,</div>
<div>Yet mutual antipathies could not be hidden.</div>
<div>Noble horses of Spanish extraction there came,</div>
<div>The chief of whose party was terribly lame;</div>
<div>For it seems that in one of his frolicsome scampers,</div>
<div>Beneath a hot sun in the wide spreading Pampas,</div>
<div>By the rich purple fruit of the Cactus allured,</div>
<div>And feeling a thirst that could not be endured,</div>
<div>He approach&#8217;d it to eat, but his nose was not proof</div>
<div>Against the sharp thorns, so he struck with his hoof,</div>
<div>When they pierced his bare foot, and so now he limp&#8217;d in</div>
<div>With his fetlock bound up in a garter-snake&#8217;s skin:</div>
<div>The vampire-bat, surgeon, now offered to bleed it,</div>
<div>In case as he thought his poor patient would need it;</div>
<div><a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And added, at least it could do him no harm</div>
<div>To try his specific, the juice of the palm.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">From the South came the puma, American lion,</div>
<div>Of the old house of Leo degenerate scion.</div>
<div>The tapir, and also that excellent diver,</div>
<div>Alligator, or Cayman, from Amazon river;</div>
<div>And with him the Llama, whose sad trick of spitting</div>
<div>Was thought by the company very unfitting.</div>
<div>But, to shorten my tale, all the New World were there,</div>
<div>From the tiny shrew mouse to the fierce grisly bear;</div>
<div>Though it seems that the peccary was not invited,</div>
<div>For he as a nuisance had just been indicted.</div>
<div>From the Old World, the lion and tiger with glee</div>
<div>Would have join&#8217;d them, but dreaded the journey by sea.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Beneath some fine trees, on the beautiful green,</div>
<div>A knot of philosophers was to be seen</div>
<div>Looking gravely about, and conversing together;</div>
<div>Some on learning and science, and some on the weather.</div>
<div>Dr. Mole on geology talk&#8217;d in high strain,</div>
<div>And declared his researches had not been in vain,</div>
<div><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And that many geologists would have been glad</div>
<div>To have found opportunities such as he had;</div>
<div>For whilst searching for food in his underground travel,</div>
<div>Midst fossils, roots, shells, hid in chalk, sand, or gravel,</div>
<div>He the monstrous remains of great mammoths had seen,</div>
<div>Who no longer existed, but who once had been;</div>
<div>&ldquo;The theories about them are various,&rdquo; said he,</div>
<div>&ldquo;As to how they came there, and what they may be;</div>
<div>But not one of these I incline to receive,</div>
<div>For that they were elephants, who can believe?</div>
<div>There was one Mr. Cuvier, who talk&#8217;d of the sloth,</div>
<div>But to listen to nonsense like this I am loth;</div>
<div>From the strength of their limbs, and the make of their paws,</div>
<div>From the shape of their bodies, and length of their claws,</div>
<div>I am firmly convinced they&#8217;re related to me,</div>
<div>And to this all philosophers ought to agree;</div>
<div>For how could such creatures have got into holes,</div>
<div>Unless, (&#8217;tis my theory,) they had been moles?&rdquo;</div>
<div>He ceased, then just turn&#8217;d his diminutive eyes,</div>
<div>First round to the company, then to the skies,</div>
<div>And receiving applause from all who sate round,</div>
<div>He threw up his hill, and escaped underground.</div>
<div><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Signor Greyhound, a foreigner, talk&#8217;d of the swamps,</div>
<div>Of the ague and fever, both caused by the damps;</div>
<div>Then quickly proceeded the climate to quiz,</div>
<div>And exclaim&#8217;d, &ldquo;In Italia we&#8217;ve nothing of this!&rdquo;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Mr. Hog said that he had sent over his daughter</div>
<div>To England, to have all the sciences taught her;</div>
<div>And learned she was, all the world must allow,</div>
<div>For the Savants pronounced her a wonderful sow.</div>
<div>She was heard to grunt forth an unwilling apology,</div>
<div>For daring to boast of her skill in Nosology,</div>
<div>And presuming to hint what a dab she&#8217;d been found,</div>
<div>At <em>extracting the root</em>, whether <em>square root</em>, or round.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Some beavers complain&#8217;d of that biped call&#8217;d man,</div>
<div>Who does to their race all the harm that he can,</div>
<div>Some of whom, not long since, came to kidnap and pillage</div>
<div>The whole of their neighbouring water-bound village,</div>
<div>And they guess&#8217;d the snake-Indians caught many a score,</div>
<div>To stew down the tails for their great Sagamore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">The hedgehog, who always lies snug in his nest,</div>
<div>Till his fourfooted neighbours betake them to rest,</div>
<div><a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Now changed his old custom for once in a way,</div>
<div>Unroll&#8217;d his warm nose, and came forth in the day.</div>
<div>He sought for the cow, and implored the good dame</div>
<div>Would find out some means to restore his fair fame,</div>
<div>For there still was prevailing a cruel belief</div>
<div>That oft in the night he came forth as a thief;</div>
<div>So he lived in continual danger and strife,</div>
<div>Though he never had tasted her milk in his life.</div>
<div>On the faith of a hedgehog he dared to affirm,</div>
<div>That he seldom found courage to injure a worm.</div>
<div>Mrs. Cow was astonish&#8217;d; she never had heard</div>
<div>A report more untrue, a belief so absurd.</div>
<div>She urged that his mouth was too little by half</div>
<div>To steal the sweet milk that she meant for Miss Calf;</div>
<div>And concluded by saying, &ldquo;&#8217;Tis surely enough</div>
<div>To mention (excuse me) your coat is so rough,</div>
<div>If even supposing that you should not fear me,</div>
<div>I never could suffer your skin to come near me.&rdquo;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">An old porcupine, too, just begg&#8217;d leave to observe,</div>
<div>That reports had been spread which he did not deserve;</div>
<div><a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>To say he was &ldquo;fretful,&rdquo; was using him ill,</div>
<div>He would prove the reverse to his very last quill;</div>
<div>Though he now bristled up at the simple idea,</div>
<div>This was often, with him, but a symptom of fear.</div>
<div>As he spoke, a poor toad, who had sate quite aloof</div>
<div>In a hovel of earth, with a stone for a roof,</div>
<div>Now slowly, on tiptoe, crept out of his hole,</div>
<div>And into the midst of the company stole;</div>
<div>The quadrupeds gazed as the reptile drew nigh,</div>
<div>Half afraid of his looks, though they could not tell why.</div>
<div>Mouse&#8217;s hair stood on end, and, still stranger to say,</div>
<div>Miss Chameleon <em>changed colour</em>, and fainted away.</div>
<div>Poor bufo confess&#8217;d, as he sate in the dark,</div>
<div>He had listen&#8217;d to porcupine&#8217;s brilliant remark,</div>
<div>And had thought it was due to himself and posterity,</div>
<div>T&#8217; expose a new case of the poets&#8217; temerity.</div>
<div>The poets, who kindly, but falsely, had said,</div>
<div>That he carried a beautiful gem in his head;</div>
<div>A jewel he thought would be quite out of place,</div>
<div>With his rustic brown coat, and his sallow green face,</div>
<div>And he knew not how people could think it was true,</div>
<div>Unless they had seen him when spangled with dew.</div>

<div>Who carried her little ones set in her skin.</div>
<div>Those alone were the jewels his friend ever wore,</div>
<div>Like Cornelia&#8217;s, the good Roman matron of yore.</div>
<div>Having stated the case with regard to attire,</div>
<div>He said, with some warmth, that he did not spit fire:</div>
<div>And he ask&#8217;d why the wise ones omitted to hint</div>
<div>Where he carried his tinder, his steel, and his flint:</div>
<div>That his time was more usefully spent, he might say,</div>
<div>In chasing the vagrants and spectres away.</div>
<div>Every member of reptile society knew</div>
<div>That of insects and grubs he destroy&#8217;d not a few:</div>
<div>His wife had just miss&#8217;d a huge pioneer spider,</div>
<div>Who fled to his home, and then rudely defied her,</div>
<div>And e&#8217;en bang&#8217;d his door in her face to deride her.</div>

<div>That the little round chamber, and long slanting hall,</div>
<div>For the want of attention, were likely to fall;</div>
<div>Such a mess and confusion he could but deplore,</div>
<div>And he thought, at the least, she might plaster the floor,</div>
<div>Just turn out of doors all the shells of her eggs,</div>
<div>And those heaps of dried beetles&#8217; and butterflies&#8217; legs.</div>
<div>The poor owl, who spoke well in the prairie-dog tongue,</div>

<div>And (as Captain Seal says) I&#8217;ll there spin a yarn.</div>
<div>I awoke very early to come to this feast,</div>
<div>Ere the sun warm&#8217;d the top of that hill in the east,</div>
<div>And forth from my lodging proceeded to creep,</div>
<div>For the wild turkey&#8217;s &lsquo;gobble&rsquo; had broken my sleep.</div>
<div>Then I climb&#8217;d some tall maize plants, and ate up the ears,</div>
<div>And enjoy&#8217;d the repast, notwithstanding my fears;</div>
<div>For great is my awe of the red Indian&#8217;s gun,</div>
<div>And I thought I had caught a slight glimpse of one.</div>
<div>I saw, too, a rattlesnake creeping hard by,</div>
<div>And heard his tail clatter, and mark&#8217;d his red eye.</div>
<div>He coil&#8217;d himself up, for he spied me right soon,</div>
<div>And was wishing, no doubt, for a bit of raccoon;</div>
<div>Then, thinking the risk of a rifle in truth,</div>
<div>Was better by far than his poisonous tooth,</div>
<div>I hasten&#8217;d away from the much dreaded place,</div>
<div>That I might not be coil&#8217;d in his slimy embrace.</div>
<div>I rambled along to our nook in the beach,</div>
<div>And swallow&#8217;d the oysters that lay within reach.</div>
<div>Then traversed in haste the Savanna so wide,</div>
<div>Till I found the tall pine where you usually hide.</div>

<div>Through forest and plain, and through dark dismal swamp,</div>
